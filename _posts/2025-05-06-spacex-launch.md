![SpaceX Launch]({{ '/assets/images/microblog/spacex-launch.gif' | relative_url }}){: .blog-image .med}

Tonight's SpaceX launch as seen from Ponte Vedra Beach, FL. First launch I have seen in a long time

Stitched images from my Fujifilm X100T. The EVF shade locked up this weekend and I'm pretty bummed about it
